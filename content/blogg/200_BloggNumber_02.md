Global Digital Small Business Insurance Survey: This time it’s personal
=======================================================================
Executive Summary
Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of every economy. They account for 99% of all firms, 70% of employment, and between 50% and 60% of value added in the OECD. They are also one of the most dynamic sectors of the economy, with 97,000 new SMEs formed each year in the UK alone.
On the face of it, SMEs should be an attractive market for insurers, commanding higher policy premiums than personal insurance. But the market is challenging, as SMEs come in all shapes and sizes and have different, and sometimes complex, needs. They often need the personalised advice of an agent or broker, but are unwilling to pay for the premium services tailored to bigger corporate clients. Could digital channels hold the answer? And are business customers ready to buy insurance online?
To find out, we spoke to 2,100 small businesses (with up to 50 employees) in 14 countries. Their responses uncovered a demand for digital insurance services that is not being met by the industry. This presents an opportunity (or a threat) for insurers. They will have to develop a clear strategy on how to deliver products and services across multiple channels. They will need to understand the evolving needs of current and prospective clients better. Finally, insurers will need to consider what is required in terms of people, processes, and technology to deliver a personalised, multichannel experience.

Here is a summary of the main findings of our Global Digital Small Business Insurance Survey {#var}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is widespread unmet demand for purchasing business insurance online. Only 24% of small businesses purchased their most recent business insurance online, perhaps due to limited offerings, but change is coming. Of the small businesses that expect to switch providers in the next five years, 48% say they’d prefer to buy online—and 65% say they are quite or very likely to do so in the future.

Business implication {#var1}
----------------------------
Insurers must start to think about what their digital offering will be, in order to serve this unmet need. There is also an opportunity to reduce the cost of acquisition and service for this segment.
Small businesses are confident about their business needs, but are often unknowingly underinsured. Today’s small businesses are confident about their business goals and insurance needs, with 74% reporting they were ‘quite’ or ‘very’ confident in their business insurance needs. However, 18% did not have liability cover and only 16% had cyber insurance, despite an additional 46% saying it could be applicable to their business.
Business implication: Insurers have an opportunity to help businesses understand the implications of being underinsured.

Insurance {#var2}
----------------------------
Personal insurance purchasing behaviour is the single biggest predictor of current and future business insurance purchasing behaviour. Despite a strongly held view that business insurance purchasing behaviour is determined by factors such as the sector a company is in, our survey revealed that attitudes are strongly influenced by personal insurance purchasing habits. Of the respondents who bought their personal insurance online, 70% said they would prefer to buy their business insurance online too.
